# diySextantScale

This repo contains high resolution images of marine sextant scales, for DIY instrument projects. 

Print scale image on inkjet printer and paste to your favourite frame material ( acrylic, wood, foamboard.. ) 

* Sextant scale images generated programatically to have geometrically correct proportions.
* Original size is for printing on A4 sized paper with 600 DPI resolution. 
* For better results use heavy 150 g/m2 paper, ink-jet or laser. 

Scales are *Vernier* kind with 3 options in respect to small minutes scale:

* 20' per tick ( with main scale degrees divided in 3)
* 30' per tick ( 1/2 deg divisions)
* 1 degree per tick ( w/ 60' Vernier )

For the large A3 sextant, I chose the 20'  w/ each degree divided in 3.
For A4 sextant, the full scale one degree vernier.

Which one is better ?
