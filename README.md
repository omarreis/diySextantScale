# diySextantScale

This repo contains high resolution images of marine sextant scales, for DIY instrument projects.

* Sextant scale images generated programatically to have geometrically correct proportions.
* Original size is for printing on A4 sized paper with 600 DPI resolution. 
* For better results use heavy 150 g/m2 paper, ink-jet or laser. 

Scales are Vernier kind with 3 options in respect to small scale tick size:
* 20' per tick
* 30' per tick
* 1 degree per tick ( w/ 60' Vernier )

The size your use depends on the instrument size.
For the large A3 sextant, I choose the 20' ( w/ each degree divided in 3 )

Which one is better ?
